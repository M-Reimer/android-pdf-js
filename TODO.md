- Make "options" work or just completely remove the whole options page.
- Review the permissions we request after wanted features are fixed and unwanted features are removed. Most probably some permissions can go.
- Access to "file://"-URLs seems to fail on Firefox. Couldn't find any way to fix this. If there is no fix, then the whole code for "file:" can go.
- Maybe replace all the PNG files with an SVG variant of the logo.
- Do we need "restoretab.html" and "restoretab.js" for Firefox?

- Make "options" work or just completely remove the whole options page.
- Review the permissions we request after wanted features are fixed and unwanted features are removed. Most probably some permissions can go.
- Access to "file://"-URLs seems to fail on Firefox. Couldn't find any way to fix this. If there is no fix, then the whole code for "file:" can go.
- Do we need "restoretab.html" and "restoretab.js" for Firefox?
- When temporarily loading our Addon, then the first PDF requests aren't redirected. Is this a bug that needs fixing?
- The "pageAction" doesn't work on Desktop-Firefox and isn't visible on Firefox for Android at all. Fix or remove.

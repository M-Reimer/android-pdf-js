      This button clears the URL cache which is used to work around <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543018">Bug 1543018</a>. Use this if URLs open in PDF.js which shouldn't. If clearing the cache fixes your problem, please open an <a href="https://github.com/M-Reimer/android-pdf-js/issues">Issue on Github</a> and describe on which page the problem happens.
